-I replaced line 402 into this:
triggerEvent(root, "impress:init", { api: roots[ "impress-root-" + rootId ], steps: steps });
That way it will be compatible with impress.js-progress (https://github.com/m42e/impress.js-progress)

-Commented lines 172 to 182, this was replaced by a "true" value to be compatible with more browsers and devices

-Lines from 548 to 555, added a new feature to change the background color according to the visible slide.
